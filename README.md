# marketman-api-scloby
looking for link the two software with an api or other

I have two software that I use for my business.
Scloby is a P.O.S. that give me the analytics.
Marketman is a web software that I use for the costs recipes, import invoices, orders, and price reports.

I have to manually export the analytics from scloby, mod the .csv file into a .exl with a layout that marketman have.
This process I have to do daily for my business.
It's possible to create an automatic process to do that?
